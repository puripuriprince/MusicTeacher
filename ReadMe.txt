This is a music education app that uses vision model, sound and a LLM to teach people how to play the instruments better.( better as in style, tempo, confidence, and creative writing)

Using magic loops to make the UI, use codebuff for coding, Nebius Ai for Vision, opennote for education advice, Beethoven.Ai for music gen.

To use, you must upload a video of you playing an instrument, i.e. the ukelele and by using vision and sound, the app suggests tips to improve. And generates a song to practice with.

Basically, upload vid, get feedback. Gen song, play it + upload vid, more feedback.(style, tempo, other stuff)

All wrapped up in a pretty and modern react UI.

in technical terms, supabase for db and users, nebius ai for vision, opennote for education advice (LLM), and beethoven ai for music gen.
